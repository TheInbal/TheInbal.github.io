# About me
Hey, my name is Inbal. I am a master's student in the Faculty of Chemistry at the Weizmann Institue.

I am on a rotation at Oren Tal's Lab. This group studies electronic transport, material properties, and energy conversion at the atomic scale.

I also have a BSc in Materials Science and engineering from Tel Aviv University.
